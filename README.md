# TimesTables

This is my solution to the TimesTables challenge project from day 35 of the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). It allows the player to select which times tables are to be tested, the desired number of questions to be asked (from which a distribution is created across the selected tables), then asks the questions and animates the correct / incorrect answers. It's colourful but I didn't really go down the cutesy route :-)
